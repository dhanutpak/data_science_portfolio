# Data Science Portfolio – Dhanut Pakdesontiskul

This portfolio collects my main data science and machine learning projects.  
Each project is in its own repository with code and a short description.

## Planned Projects

These will be added to the portfolio:

4. **Time Series – LSTM Forecasting**  
   - Example: stock or sales forecasting with LSTM/GRU.

5. **NLP – Sentiment Analysis (IMDb / DistilBERT)**  
   - Text classification using transformers.

Once completed, each project will have its own repository and be linked here.
